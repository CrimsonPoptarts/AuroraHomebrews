            <p>At 3rd level, your bond with the arcane wild grants you a primal gift. Choose one of the following blessings shaped by the whispering wilderness:</p>
            <h5 class="caption">BLOOMCALLER’S GRACE</h5>
            <p>When you summon a creature, it is wreathed in moss and blossoms. It gains temporary hit points equal to (3 × your (Constitution modifier + Greenspeaker level))/6 rounded down, and +10 feet movement for 1 minute. The first time it would drop to 0 hit points, it instead drops to 1 and releases a pulse of pollen—each ally within 10 feet of it regains hit points equal to (3 × your (Constitution modifier + Greenspeaker level))/6 rounded down.</p>
            <h5 class="caption">SPIRITWEAVE</h5>
            <p>While you have a summoned creature within 60 feet, you gain a +(Greenspeaker Level/3) bonus to AC and saving throws. Once per turn when you cast a spell, one of your summoned creatures may move up to 10 feet without provoking opportunity attacks. This benefit ends if you no longer control any summoned creatures.</p>
            <h5 class="caption">WHISPERBLOOM</h5>
            <p>The first attack each of your summoned creatures makes on its turn deals additional psychic damage equal to your Greenspeaker level + (proficiency bonus x 2). Once per long rest, your summoned creatures can release a haunting bloom. Enemies within 10 feet of them must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier) or be frightened until the end of their next turn.</p>
