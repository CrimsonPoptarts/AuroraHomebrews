            <p>At 3rd level, the Wyld's blessing grants you a savage gift of primal might. Choose one of the following features:</p>
            <h5 class="caption">Predator’s Rush</h5>
            <p>As a bonus action, surge up to your movement speed. You can move through enemy spaces without provoking opportunity attacks. Each enemy you pass through must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) or take 1d10 + your Strength modifier bludgeoning damage and be pushed 5 feet in a direction of your choice.</p>
            <p class="indent">If you end your movement adjacent to one of your summoned creatures, you and that creature gain a +2 bonus to melee attack damage until the end of your next turn.</p>
            <p class="indent">Damage increases to 2d10 at 7th level and 3d12 at 15th level. You can use this feature once per short rest at 3rd–6th level, twice per short rest at 7th–14th, and three times per short rest at 15th level and beyond.</p>
            <h5 class="caption">Primal Rend</h5>
            <p>When you hit a creature with a melee weapon or natural weapon attack, you can rend the wound open. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) or begin bleeding, taking damage equal to your Strength modifier at the start of each of its turns for 1 minute, or until it receives magical healing or uses an action to staunch the wound.</p>
            <p class="indent">At 11th level, the bleed damage increases to twice your Strength modifier. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns. You can use this feature once per short rest at 3rd–6th level, twice per short rest at 7th–14th, and three times per short rest at 15th level and beyond.</p>
            <h5 class="caption">Alpha's Command</h5>
            <p>As a bonus action, unleash a feral roar. Up to two of your summoned creatures or allies within 30 feet can immediately use their reaction to move up to their speed and make one melee weapon or natural weapon attack.</p>
            <p class="indent">Enemies within 10 feet of you must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier) or be frightened until the end of their next turn.</p>
            <p class="indent">The number of affected allies increases to three at 7th level and four at 15th level. You can use this feature once per short rest at 3rd–6th level, twice per short rest at 7th–14th, and three times per short rest at 15th level and beyond.</p>
