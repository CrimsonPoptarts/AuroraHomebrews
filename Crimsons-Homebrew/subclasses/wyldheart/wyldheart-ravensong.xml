			<p>At 3rd level, the Wyld's blessing grants you a gift that enhances your bond with the wild beasts. You gain one of the following features of your choice.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">Mourning Veil</h5>
			<p>Your presence cloaks both you and your summons in the mourning garb of the spirit world.</p>
            <p class="indent">When you summon a creature, both you and it become wreathed in ghostly shadows until the end of your next turn. While shrouded, you each have resistance to magical damage, and are invisible to creatures more than 15 feet away.</p>
            <p class="indent">If a shrouded creature (you or your summon) is reduced to 0 HP, it lets out a haunting wail. Enemies within 10 feet must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier) or be silenced until the end of their next turn (no speech or verbal components).</p>
			<h5 class="caption">Echo of the Unseen</h5>
            <p>The whispers of your summons tie fate into knots, binding enemies in threads of foreboding.</p>
			<p class = "indent">While you have a summoned creature within 60 feet, you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.</p>
            <p class="indent">Once per turn when a summoned creature misses an attack, you may use your reaction to teleport to an unoccupied space within 10 feet of it.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">Omenbound Pact</h5>
			<p>The whispers of your summons tie fate into knots, binding enemies in threads of foreboding.</p>
            <p class = "indent">The first time each summoned creature hits with an attack on its turn, you can force the target to make a Charisma saving throw (DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier). On a failure, it is cursed with an omen.</p>
			 <p class="indent">While cursed, the target has disadvantage on their first attack roll or saving throw it makes after being cursed.</p>
            <p class="indent">Twice per long rest, you may utter a Raven Song as an action. All enemies cursed by an omen within 30 feet take psychic damage equal to your Ravensong Level × your (Intelligence modifier) / 1.25 rounded down, and must roll a d6. On a 1, they are stunned until the start of their next turn.</p>
