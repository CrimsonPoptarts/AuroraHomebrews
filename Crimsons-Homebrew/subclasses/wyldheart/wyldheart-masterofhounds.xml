			<p>At 3rd level, the Wyld's blessing grants you a gift that enhances your bond with the wild beasts. You gain one of the following features of your choice.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">BEASTLY ALLY</h5>
			<p>Your connection to beasts becomes stronger. When you summon a beast companion or a summoned beast is within 30 feet of you, you gain a +2 bonus to your Dexterity saving throws. This goes to +3 at level 5, +4 at level 10, etc. Additionally, if the beast is within 5 feet of you, it can add your (Dexterity modifier x Master of Hounds level)/3 rounded down to its attack rolls.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">FERAL INSTINCTS</h5>
			<p>The primal forces awaken your reflexes. You gain proficiency in Stealth, and when you make a Stealth check while in natural terrain, you can add twice your Dexterity modifier instead of once. Additionally, when a creature attempts to hit you with an attack, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on that attack roll if the attacker is within 30 feet of you and the attack is coming from a creature that is either a beast or a fey. Lastly, you have advantage on initiative rolls.</p>
			<h5 class="caption">PACK LEADER</h5>
			<p>Your bond with your pack deepens. When you use the Help action, you can grant the creature you aid advantage on the next attack roll or saving throw it makes, as long as it is within 30 feet of you. Additionally, when your beast companion hits a creature with an attack, it can make an additional attack against the same target using its bonus action. This can be used a number of times equal to your Dexterity modifier per long rest.</p>
