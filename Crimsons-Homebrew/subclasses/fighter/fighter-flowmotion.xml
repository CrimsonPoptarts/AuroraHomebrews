            <p>Flowmotion Fighters transform their own movement into a weapon. With a perfect blend
                of speed and precision, they chain jumps, spins, and attacks in a seamless flow that
                overwhelms opponents before they can react.</p>

            <p>You master chaining your motion into relentless offense. When you Dash, Jump, or
                Disengage as a bonus action, you can immediately move 10 feet in any direction as a
                free action. This movement can be vertical or along surfaces without falling until
                the end of your turn.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can use this free movement once per turn at 3rd level, twice at
                7th level, and three times at 15th level.</p>
