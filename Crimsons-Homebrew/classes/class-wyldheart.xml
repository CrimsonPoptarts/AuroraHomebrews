		<description>
            <p>Golden eyes flashing, a human stretches out her hand and unleashes the primal magic that courses through her veins. As an inferno rages around her foes, spectral wings of flame emerge from her back, lifting her above the chaos.</p>
            <p class="indent">Hair flowing like a storm, a half-elf raises his arms to the sky. A surge of elemental energy crackles through him, erupting in a devastating wave of lightning that leaves the battlefield scorched and trembling.</p>
            <p class="indent">With a feral grin, a halfling leaps into the fray, her hands wreathed in flickering green flames. As she strikes, the flames lash out, consuming her enemies in a blaze of wild, untamed power.</p>
            <p class="indent">Wyldhearts are conduits of raw, unbridled magic, their power drawn from the untamed forces of nature, the elements, or even the chaotic weave of magic itself. Unlike wizards who study their craft or warlocks who bargain for their power, Wyldhearts are born with their gifts, their magic as much a part of them as their heartbeat.</p>
            <h4>PRIMAL MAGIC</h4>
            <p>The magic of a Wyldheart is wild and unpredictable, a force that defies control and demands to be unleashed. Some Wyldhearts draw their power from the elemental planes, channeling fire, water, air, or earth in its purest form. Others are touched by the chaotic essence of the Feywild or the Shadowfell, their magic a reflection of these strange and otherworldly realms.</p>
            <p class="indent">The source of a Wyldheart's power is as unique as the individual. It might be the result of a fateful encounter with a powerful elemental, a blessing—or curse—from a capricious fey, or the lingering effects of a magical catastrophe. Whatever its origin, this power is both a gift and a burden, a force that shapes the Wyldheart's destiny.</p>
            <h4>UNLEASHED POWER</h4>
            <p>Wyldhearts are adventurers by necessity, their magic too volatile to remain dormant. Whether they seek to master their abilities, uncover the truth of their origins, or simply survive in a world that fears their power, Wyldhearts are driven to explore, to fight, and to grow stronger.</p>
            <p class="indent">Their magic is as versatile as it is unpredictable, allowing them to adapt to any situation. A Wyldheart might summon a storm to scatter their enemies, heal their allies with a touch of primal energy, or transform themselves into a creature of pure elemental fury. Whatever the challenge, a Wyldheart meets it head-on, their power a force of nature that cannot be denied.</p>
            <h4>CREATING A WYLDHEART</h4>
            <p>When creating a Wyldheart, consider the source of your character's power. Was it a gift from a powerful being, an accident of birth, or the result of a life-changing event? How does your character feel about their abilities? Do they embrace their power, fear it, or struggle to control it? What drives them to adventure, and how does their magic shape their goals and relationships?</p>
            <p class="indent">Your choice of background, skills, and spells should reflect your character's connection to their magic. A Wyldheart with ties to the elemental planes might favor spells like *Burning Hands* or *Thunderwave*, while one touched by the Feywild might lean toward enchantments and illusions. Whatever path you choose, your Wyldheart's magic is a reflection of their unique story.</p>

		<description>
			<p>Your bond with the primal forces of nature and your connection to your Wyld Companion allows you to wield magic as a channel of the world's wild and untamed essence. This power is not studied or inherited through bloodlines—it is a living force you attune to through instinct, emotion, and empathy.</p>
			<h5>CANTRIPS</h5>
			<p>At 1st level, you know four cantrips of your choice from the druid spell list. You learn additional cantrips at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wyldheart table.</p>
			<h5>SPELL SLOTS</h5>
			<p>The Wyldheart table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these Wyldheart spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent">For example, if you know the 1st-level spell *entangle* and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast *entangle* using either slot.</p>
			<h5>SPELLS KNOWN OF 1ST LEVEL AND HIGHER</h5>
			<p>You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the druid spell list.</p>
			<p class="indent">The Spells Known column of the Wyldheart table shows when you learn more spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.</p>
			<p class="indent">Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the Wyldheart spells you know and replace it with another spell from the druid spell list, which must also be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
			<h5>SPELLCASTING ABILITY</h5>
			<p>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Wyldheart spells, as your magic flows from your connection to wild spirits and your ability to channel their will. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a Wyldheart spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
			<center>
				<p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>
				<p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>
			</center>
			<h5>SPELLCASTING FOCUS</h5>
			<p>You can use a druidic focus as a spellcasting focus for your Wyldheart spells.</p>
